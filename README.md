# 05_Third_Party_APIs_Calendar_Application

This is a Work Day Calendar built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery and Moment.js library.

I updated the  code to meet the following acceptance criteria:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

Please see [live page here](https://mattg-git.github.io/05_Third_Party_APIs_Calendar_Application/) and screenshot of project below.
